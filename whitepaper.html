<details> <summary><strong>5. Blockchain Fundamentals & Consensus Rationale</strong></summary> <p><b>Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger technology. Transactions are recorded across a peer-to-peer network of computers, ensuring transparency and resilience. The term “blockchain” originates from its structure: individual records, known as blocks, are linked together in a chronological sequence — forming a chain.</b></p>

<p><b>Each block contains transaction metadata, including the timestamp, blockchain version, previous block hash, Merkle Root, a unique nonce assigned during mining, and the parties involved. Once added to the chain, a block becomes immutable — resistant to tampering, fraud, or deletion.</b></p>

<h4><b>Key Benefits of Blockchain Technology</b></h4> <ul> <li><b>Decentralization</b>: Unlike traditional systems governed by central banks or authorities, blockchain operates without intermediaries. Transactions are validated by a distributed network, reducing the risk of centralization.</li> <li><b>Money Transfer</b>: Blockchain enables fast, secure, and efficient fund transfers across borders.</li> <li><b>Supply Chain Management</b>: It offers transparency and traceability, helping verify product authenticity and prevent fraud.</li> <li><b>Cybersecurity</b>: Its immutable and decentralized nature makes it ideal for securing digital infrastructure.</li> <li><b>Transparency</b>: Every action is recorded and visible to all participants, fostering trust.</li> <li><b>Security</b>: Cryptographic mechanisms and distributed consensus make blockchain highly resistant to attacks.</li> <li><b>Efficiency</b>: By removing intermediaries, blockchain streamlines operations like commodity trading and cross-border payments.</li> </ul>

<h4><b>Why We Chose Proof of Work (PoW)</b></h4> <p><b>Soteria Network is free and open source. All coins are fairly issued and mined publicly using the SoterG algorithm — a GPU-friendly, ASIC-resistant Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism.</b></p>

<p><b>We chose PoW because it builds a time-based computational barrier that strengthens data integrity with each new block. This structure protects user data from future tampering and censorship.</b></p>

<p><b>The SoterG algorithm was selected over other PoW variants due to its resistance to ASIC dominance and its compatibility with commodity GPUs. This ensures a fairer mining landscape and prevents centralization by large mining farms.</b></p>

<h4><b>Consensus and Network Coherence</b></h4> <p><b>Building a decentralized, censorship-resistant system introduces technical challenges. One of the most complex is maintaining a coherent global state across all nodes. PoW addresses this by enforcing consensus rules that reject invalid transactions and synchronize the network.</b></p>

<p><b>While performance doesn’t scale linearly with node count, security improves as more nodes join. This enhances geographic connectivity and strengthens the network’s resilience.</b></p>

<p><b>Operating a node is simple and empowers users with direct access to the network. It eliminates reliance on third-party services, improves privacy, and gives operators full control over their interactions with Soteria.</b></p>

<p><b>PoW also ensures fair distribution. Anyone with computing power can participate and earn block rewards. It provides an objective method to validate the chain without external dependencies.</b></p> </details>

<details> <summary><strong>6. Project Ethos</strong></summary> <p><b>Soteria Network is built on the principles of decentralization, transparency, and community empowerment. Unlike many modern crypto ventures, we embrace a Proof-of-Work model with the following characteristics:</b></p> <ul> <li><b>No Venture Capital Funding</b>: The project was launched without external investment, ensuring no centralized influence or profit-driven roadmap.</li> <li><b>No Corporate Entity</b>: There is no company or foundation behind the Soteria Network, reinforcing its neutrality and censorship resistance.</li> <li><b>No Formal Employees</b>: Development is driven by a full-time lead developer and a small group of contributors. Anyone is welcome to participate through open-source collaboration.</li> <li><b>No Ownership Transferability</b>: The Soteria Network cannot be sold or acquired by third parties, preserving its mission and long-term independence.</li> <li><b>No Bankruptcy Risk</b>: As a decentralized network, it cannot “go out of business.” It persists as long as miners, users, and contributors remain active.</li> </ul> </details>

<details> <summary><strong>7. Mining Model</strong></summary> <p><b>Soteria Network uses a GPU-friendly PoW model optimized for speed and fairness:</b></p> <ul> <li><b>SoterG Algorithm</b>: Combines 12 energy-efficient hash functions with dynamic rotation and timestamping.</li> <li><b>Miner Allocation</b>: 30% of block rewards are allocated to miners.</li> </ul> <p><b>SoterG Optimization</b><br> In testnet, mining contexts were allocated as 12 simultaneous stack structs per round, leading to high stack usage and potential instability. For mainnet, Soteria will allocate only one context per round, significantly reducing stack pressure, improving cache locality, and enabling future GPU offload and backend-agnostic dispatch. This change enhances performance, stability, and memory efficiency.</p> </details>

<details> <summary><strong>8. Difficulty Adjustment</strong></summary> <h4>8.1 LWMA-3 Algorithm</h4> <p><b>The Soteria Network employs the Linear Weighted Moving Average version 3 (LWMA-3) difficulty adjustment algorithm. LWMA-3 offers superior stability compared to traditional methods while maintaining rapid responsiveness to hash rate fluctuations. This design enables the network to sustain a 12‑second target block time with a 10‑second buffer, positioning Soteria Network among the fastest UTXO-based blockchains.</b></p>

<h3>8.2 Weighted Averaging</h3> <p><b>The algorithm calculates difficulty using a default weighted average of the most recent 90 blocks, applying linear weighting to give greater importance to the latest blocks. This ensures responsive adjustment to sudden changes in network hash power.</b></p>

<h3>8.3 Target Accuracy</h3> <p><b>LWMA-3 maintains the target block interval of 12 seconds with minimal variance, even under conditions of rapid hash rate swings or temporary network disruptions. This accuracy supports consistent transaction throughput and predictable confirmation times.</b></p>

<h3>8.4 Attack Resistance</h3> <p><b>The algorithm is designed to resist timestamp manipulation attacks and provides strong protection against difficulty oscillation exploits. This enhances overall network stability and security.</b></p>

<h3>8.5 Configurable Parameters</h3> <p><b>LWMA-3 supports flexible configuration, including:</b></p> <ul> <li>Window size (number of blocks considered in averaging)</li> <li>Minimum difficulty floor to prevent excessively low targets</li> <li>Target block time for network-specific optimization</li> </ul> <p><b>These parameters allow fine-tuning of performance and resilience to match the evolving needs of the Soteria Network.</b></p> </details>

<details> <summary><strong>9. Native Coin Tokenomics ($SOTER)</strong></summary> <p><b>The tokenomics of $SOTER are meticulously crafted to ensure fairness, stability, and long-term growth. Its distribution model promotes inclusivity, while supply dynamics balance scarcity and liquidity. Innovative inflation/deflation mechanisms and the utility within the ecosystem further enhance its value proposition, fostering a thriving community and sustainable development.</b></p>

<details> <summary><strong>10. Block Subsidy Schedule & Monetary Policy</strong></summary> <p><b>Soteria Network uses a gradual block subsidy reduction model to ensure long-term sustainability, miner fairness, and predictable supply dynamics.</b></p>

<p><b>Unlike traditional halving models that reduce block rewards by 50% every few years, Soteria Network uses a gradual reduction schedule designed with miner sustainability in mind. This approach avoids sudden shocks, aligns with ecosystem growth phases, and reflects what miners actually need to continue supporting the network long-term.</b></p>

<p><b>The initial block subsidy is set at <strong>0.140 SOTER per block</strong>, with reductions every 3 million blocks. Given the fixed block time of <strong>12 seconds</strong>, this equates to approximately one reduction every <strong>416 days</strong>.</b></p>

<p><b>The subsidy decreases by <strong>0.005 SOTER per block</strong> at each interval, reaching a final subsidy of <strong>0.005 SOTER per block</strong> after block height 81,000,000.</b></p>

<p><b>After block height 81,000,000, the block subsidy will remain fixed at 0.005 SOTER per block forever. This final emission rate ensures long-term sustainability, predictable supply, and continued miner participation without abrupt halving events, and this has negligible annual inflation rate on the ecosystem.</b></p> 

<h2><b>Why the Classic Halving Model Can Be Problematic</b></h2> <ul> <li><b>Sudden drops</b>: A 50% cut overnight can shock miners, destabilize hash rate, and disrupt network security.</li> <li><b>Speculative pressure</b>: Halvings often trigger hype cycles and volatility, which can hurt real users and builders.</li> <li><b>Unsustainable incentives</b>: Miners may abandon the chain if rewards drop too fast and fees don’t compensate.</li> <li><b>No nuance</b>: It ignores ecosystem maturity, adoption phases, and real-world development timelines.</li> </ul>

<h2><b>Why This Model We Think Is Smarter</b></h2> <ul> <li><b>Gradual reduction</b>: We’ve implemented a smooth, predictable decline — 0.005 SOTER every ~416 days — which gives miners time to adapt.</li> <li><b>Phase-aware</b>: We’ve aligned subsidy changes with ecosystem milestones, not arbitrary dates.</li> <li><b>Miner-first logic</b>: We designed it based on what we would want as miners — not just what looks good on paper.</li> <li><b>Long-term sustainability</b>: It balances early incentives with future scarcity, without punishing contributors too soon.</li> </ul>

<p><b>This model ensures a smooth transition from high-incentive mining to a more utility-driven ecosystem, balancing miner rewards with long-term supply control.</b></p>

<blockquote> The total supply until the block reward reaches 0.005 SOTER per block will be approximately 6,000,000 coins, with this final subsidy occurring at block height 81,000,000. After that point, the annual coin emission will be approximately 13,000 SOTER. </blockquote> </details>

<details> <summary><strong>16. Staking Program</strong></summary> <p><b>Soteria Network aims to enrich the lives of crypto enthusiasts by offering a currency that powers the entire ecosystem. Beyond mining, stakers and holders will be empowered through funding mechanisms and long-term incentives.</b></p>

<p><b>To support long-term holding and ecosystem growth, Soteria Network will introduce a staking program launching <u>eight–ten months after listing</u>.</b></p>

<p><b>Stakers will be able to lock their coins for fixed durations and earn rewards based on the length of their commitment. The staking tiers are as follows:</b></p> <ul> <li><b>30 days</b>: 4% APY</li> <li><b>90 days</b>: 6% APY</li> <li><b>120 days</b>: 8% APY</li> <li><b>180 days</b>: 10% APY</li> <li><b>360 days</b>: 12.5% APY</li> </ul>

<p><b>Rewards will be distributed in SOTER coins and calculated based on the staked amount and duration. The staking interface will be available via the Soteria website, with support for both desktop and mobile wallets.</b></p>

<p><b>Staking is non-custodial — users retain full control of their wallets and private keys. Early withdrawal before the selected term will result in forfeiture of rewards.</b></p>

<p><b>This program is designed to incentivize long-term participation, reduce market volatility, and strengthen community engagement.</b></p> </details>

<details> <summary><strong>17. Backer Rewards Program</strong></summary> <p><b>Soteria Network is a community-driven project, and we welcome voluntary donations from supporters who wish to help accelerate development, infrastructure, and outreach.</b></p>

<p><b>Donations are entirely optional and may be made using BTC, ETH, USDT, BNB, SOL, or SOTER. All contributions will be used to support technical improvements, cover node hosting costs, server costs, launch new nodes, fund exchange listings, and expand Soteria Network across multiple blockchains.</b></p>

<p><b>To recognize and reward those who support the growth of Soteria Network, <u>6% of each block reward</u> is allocated to a dedicated pool for backers and donors, and an additional <u>10%</u> is allocated to a pool specifically for exchange listings as in the tokenomics. So in total they will get <u>16%</u> of each block reward each month.</b></p>

<p><b>Donors will receive monthly distributions from these pools, calculated based on their contribution level and duration of support. Payments will be made in SOTER, with transparent tracking and wallet-based eligibility.</b></p>

<p><b>In addition to monthly distributions, donors will gain exclusive access to future airdrops of coins and tokens launched within the Soteria ecosystem. They will also receive a share of platform profits, distributed annually, as part of our broader community dividend model.</b></p>

<p><b>This program is designed to reward genuine supporters, foster long-term engagement, and ensure that those who help build Soteria share in its success.</b></p>

<p><b>Donation addresses and contribution instructions are available on the official website at <a href="https://soteria-network.site">https://soteria-network.site</a></b></p>

As part of our profit-sharing model, we will allocate at least <u>2% of platform profits annually</u> to charitable initiatives focused on supporting people in need — especially children from underprivileged families.</b></p>

<p><b>This fund will prioritize causes where even small contributions can make a real difference, such as access to food, education, shelter, and digital tools for learning. We recognize that children cannot legally work in most countries and often face systemic barriers to opportunity. By dedicating a portion of our profits to these efforts, we aim to help bridge that gap and empower the next generation.</b></p>

<p><b>Donations will be made once per year, allowing the team to focus on core development while still contributing meaningfully to global causes. All charitable contributions will be transparently tracked and published in an annual impact report. The community may also participate in nominating or voting on supported causes through future governance modules.</b></p>

<p><b>This initiative reflects our belief that blockchain technology can empower not only individuals and businesses, but also communities in need — especially those who are too young to advocate for themselves.</b></p> </details> </details>

<details> <summary><strong>18. Economic Model</strong></summary> <p><b>As part of our deflationary strategy, <u>20% of platform profits</u> will be used to buy and burn Soter coins. This mechanism is inspired by Ethereum’s EIP-1559 model and is designed to reduce inflation, stabilize value, and reward long-term holders.</b></p>

<details> <summary><strong>18.1 Network Fees Structure</strong></summary> <p><b>Transaction fees are determined by the size of each transaction, which consists of multiple inputs and outputs. Since each block has a maximum capacity of 2MB, larger transactions consume more space and therefore require higher fees.</b></p>

<p><b>Transaction fees also influence processing speed. In periods of high network activity or transaction backlog, users can offer higher fees to incentivize miners to prioritize their transactions for inclusion in the next block. Conversely, when network activity is low, fees tend to decrease.</b></p>

<p><b>This dynamic causes fees to fluctuate based on overall network demand. A minimum fee of <u>0.001 SOTER per kilobyte (kB)</u> is required, and the wallet automatically calculates the appropriate fee based on transaction size and current network conditions.</b></p> </details>

<details> <summary><strong>18.2 Fee Distribution</strong></summary> <p><b>All transaction fees are awarded to miners, providing direct economic incentives to secure and validate the network. The fee structure is designed to prevent spam while remaining accessible for legitimate use cases.</b></p> </details>

<details> <summary><strong>18.3 Mining Rewards</strong></summary> <p><b>Block rewards consist of both newly mined coins and transaction fees, offering sustainable incentives for miners.</b></p> </details>

<details> <summary><strong>18.4 Mining Incentives</strong></summary> <p><b>Mining profitability is sustained through a combination of block rewards and transaction fees. As block rewards gradually decrease over time, transaction fees become increasingly vital for miner compensation, incentivizing greater network usage and adoption. This economic model creates a positive feedback loop: increased usage generates higher fees and mining profitability, which enhances network security and attracts more users and investors to the ecosystem.</b></p> </details> </details>
